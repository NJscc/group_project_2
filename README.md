# Stardew Forum website

## Overview  

Our application is intended to allow a user to create or login
to a profile on our forum, and 

then either create new topics within
the given categories, or create new posts under a listed topic. This
will let they communicate about the 

game with other users on the 
website. They can also place tags on their topics or posts 
for sorting them, or to clarify their purpose. 

## User Story

    SO THAT I can help others enjoy the game too

## Technologies Used 

Our website uses the Cloudinary widget to store images uploaded by the 
user on a 

server, where they can be accessed and displayed in the
user profile.

## Future Project Direction and Development

There are many ways we could add functionality to the forum in the future.
We could add many additional 

fields to the user profile, possibly including 
elements of the user's in-game character. We could also 

expand the number of 
categories, as well as add functionality for users to remove their topics or posts.
