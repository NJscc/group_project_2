## Description 

 ### Overview  

    Our application is intended to allow a user to create or login
    to a profile on our forum, and then either create new topics within
    the given categories, or create new posts under a listed topic. This 
    will let they communicate about the game with other users on the

    for sorting them, or to clarify their purpose.
